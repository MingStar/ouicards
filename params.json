{"name":"Ouicards","tagline":"JavaScript Flashcard Generator","body":"# Ouicards - Fancy Schmancy Flashcards\r\nEasy to use flashcards to study for... whatever. The example provided is for the New York State Immigration Naturalization test.\r\n\r\n## Using Ouicards\r\nThe first thing you'll need is an array of Question/ Answer objects.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n    \r\n    var flashcards = [\r\n      {question: \"Who build this?\", answer: \"Carl Sednaoui\"}, \r\n      {question: \"Where was Ouicards made?\", answer: \"In NYC, during Hacker School\"}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou can then use the functions outlined below.\r\n\r\n## Functions Available\r\n\r\n    ouicards.changeQuestion(arrayForRdnNm, flashcards, qSelector, aSelector)\r\n      // arrayForRdnNm: This can either be your entire set of flashcards or an array of saved question numbers\r\n      // flashcards: These are the flashcards you are trying to learn\r\n      // qSelector: Your html question selector. This will be used by jQuery to find and replace your question html content.\r\n      // aSelector: Your html answer selector. This will be used by jQuery to find and replace your answer html content.\r\n\r\n    ouicards.clearLocalStorage(saveButtonSelector)\r\n      // Clears saved ouicards from localstorage.\r\n      // saveButtonSelector: The html selector for your save button. This will be used to update the button copy\r\n      //  and will read as follows: \"Saved: 1 question\"\r\n    \r\n    ouicards.saveToLocalStorage(questionID)\r\n      // Save a given question to ouicards localstorage\r\n    \r\n    ouicards.getFromLocalStorage()\r\n      // Get saved ouicards from localstorage\r\n\r\n    ouicards.updateSaveButtonCopy(saveButtonSelector)\r\n      // Updates your save button copy. Similar to ouicards.clearLocalStorage(saveButtonSelector)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other functions available - which you probably won't use\r\n\r\n    ouicards.generateRandomNumber(arrayForRdnNm, flashcards)\r\n      // Generate a random number. Used by ouical.changeQuestion(arrayForRdnNm, flashcards, qSelector, aSelector)\r\n\r\n    ouicards.buildQuestionHTML(questionNumber, flashcards)\r\n      // Builds your questions/ answer html. Also used by ouical.changeQuestion(arrayForRdnNm, flashcards, qSelector, aSelector)\r\n    \r\n## To Do\r\n- Implement the [Leitner System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)","google":"UA-23209172-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
