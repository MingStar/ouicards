{"name":"Ouicards","tagline":"JavaScript Flashcard Generator","body":"# Ouicards - Fancy Schmancy Flashcards\r\nEasy to use flashcards to study for... whatever. Ouicards uses a 3-bucket [Leitner System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) and relies on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [localStorage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html).\r\n\r\nThe example provided is for the New York State Immigration Naturalization test. __Note:__ This example was built in June 2013 and may be outdated by the time you see it.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nYou can find a [live example here](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouicards/Example/index.html).\r\n\r\n## Using Ouicards\r\nThe first thing you'll need is an array of Question/ Answer objects.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n    \r\n    var flashcards = [\r\n      {question: \"Who build this?\", answer: \"Carl Sednaoui\"}, \r\n      {question: \"Where was Ouicards made?\", answer: \"In NYC, during Hacker School\"}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou can then use the functions outlined below.\r\n\r\n## Functions Available\r\n  \r\n    ouicards.loadFromArray(flashcardArray)\r\n      // [{question: q1, answer: a1}, {question: q2, answer: a2}]\r\n    ouicards.loadFromBrowser(jQuerySelector, Delimiter)\r\n      // Your delimeter will most likely be ',' or '\\t'\r\n    ouicards.getFromLS()\r\n      // Get the questions and buckets from localStorge\r\n    ouicards.correct()\r\n      // Call this when the current question was answered correctly\r\n    ouicards.wrong()\r\n      // Call this when the current question was answered incorrectly\r\n    ouicards.next()\r\n      // Call this to receive a new Question/ Answer object\r\n\r\n### Everything You Have Access To\r\n    \r\n    ouicards.currentBucket: The bucket from which the current card is being pulled.\r\n    ouicards.flashcards: Your array of flashcards.\r\n    ouicards.bucketA: All questions available in Bucket A.\r\n    ouicards.bucketB: All questions available in Bucket B.\r\n    ouicards.bucketC: All questions available in Bucket C.\r\n    ouicards.counter: A running counter. Used to know which bucket to get the next question from.\r\n\r\n    ouicards.loadFromBrowser(selector, delimiter) \r\n      // Uses jQuery to load the value of a given selector.\r\n      // This saves the questions into ouicards, localStorage AND \r\n        // returns an object with Flashcards, Bucket A, B and C.\r\n    ouicards.loadFromArray(array)\r\n      // Loads the array of questions provided into ouicards and localStorage.\r\n    ouicards.getQuestion(bucket)\r\n      // Gets a question for a given bucket and returns the built question HTML for it.\r\n    ouicards.buildQuestionHTML(rawQuestion)\r\n      // Returns a question/ answer HTML object {question: questionEl, answer: answerEl}.\r\n    ouicards.moveQuestion(fromBucket, toBucket)\r\n     // Moves a question from a given bucket to another given bucket.\r\n\r\n    ouicards.next()\r\n      // Returns a new question/ answer object.\r\n    ouicards.correct()\r\n      // Moves the current question to the next appropriate bucket.\r\n    ouicards.wrong()\r\n      // Moves the current question to Bucket A.\r\n    ouicards.saveToLS()\r\n      // Saves your flashcards, Bucket A, Bucket B and Bucket C to localStorage.\r\n    ouicards.getFromLS()\r\n      // Gets your flashcards, Bucket A, Bucket B and Bucket C from localStorage. \r\n      // This also sets ouicards.currentBucket and ouicards.counter.\r\n    ouicards.resetBuckets()\r\n      // Resets ouicards buckets. \r\n      // Bucket A will equal your flashcards array. Bucket B and C will be empty arrays.  \r\n      // Your currentBucket will also be empty and all of this will get saved to localStorage.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nHave feedback or suggestions?
