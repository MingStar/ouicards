{"name":"Ouicards","tagline":"JavaScript Flashcard Generator","body":"# Ouicards - Fancy Schmancy Flashcards\r\nOuicards allows you to easily build flashcards to study for... everything! \r\n\r\nOuicards uses a 3-bucket [Leitner System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) and relies on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [localStorage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html).\r\n\r\n[Here is the official OuiCards page](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouicards/).\r\n\r\n## About the Leitner System\r\nFrom the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system): \r\n\r\nThe Leitner system is a widely used method to efficiently use flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. __It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing interval.__\r\n\r\nIn this method flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well you know each one in the Leitner's learning box. This is how it works: you try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If you succeed, you send the card to the next group. But if you fail, you send it back to the first group. __Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before you are required to revisit the cards.__\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n[Here's a ouicards example](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouicards/live-examples/index.html), created for the New York State Immigration Naturalization test. \r\n\r\n__Note:__ This example was built in June 2013 and may be outdated by the time you see it.\r\n\r\n## Using Ouicards\r\n\r\n### > As a jQuery plugin\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to quickly get running with OuiCards, you can simply create a \\<ul> with the right CSS Classes and OuiCards will take care of the rest.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- A div containing a \\<ul> where you'll create your questions and answers. In the example below this is this div: \\<div id='flashcards'>\r\n- \\<li>'s holding 2 divs. One for the question (with a class of 'question') and one for the answer (with a class of 'answer')\r\n- A div with an id of 'current-question', to show the question\r\n- A div with an id of 'current-answer', to show the answer\r\n- A link with an id of 'show-answer', to reveal the answer (by default you'll only see the question at first)\r\n- A link with an id of 'correct', which a user will click if they get the question right\r\n- A link with an id of 'wrong', which a user will click if they get the question wrong\r\n\r\nHere's some example code ([also available here](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouicards/live-examples/ouicards-jquery-example.html)):\r\n\r\n    <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n      <title>Welcome</title>\r\n      <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n      <script src=\"../ouicards.js\"></script>\r\n      <script>\r\n        $(function() { \r\n          $('#flashcards').ouicards(); \r\n        });\r\n      </script>\r\n    </head>\r\n\r\n    <body>\r\n      <h1>Ouicards jQuery!</h1>\r\n      <div id='flashcards'>\r\n        <div id='current-question'></div>\r\n        <div id='current-answer'></div>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <div class='question'>Question 1</div>\r\n            <div class='answer'>Answer 1</div>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <div class='question'>Question 2</div>\r\n            <div class='answer'>Answer 2</div>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <div class='question'>Question 3</div>\r\n            <div class='answer'>Answer 3</div>\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <a id='show-answer' href='#'>Show answer</a>\r\n        <a id=\"correct\" href=\"#\">Correct</a>\r\n        <a id=\"wrong\" href=\"#\">Wrong</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\n### > As a JavaScript Library\r\nWelcome to the big leagues! The first thing you'll need is an array of Question/ Answer objects.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n    \r\n    var flashcards = [\r\n      {question: \"Who build this?\", answer: \"Carl Sednaoui\"}, \r\n      {question: \"Where was Ouicards made?\", answer: \"In NYC, during Hacker School\"}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nYou can then use the functions outlined below.\r\n\r\n#### Functions Available\r\n  \r\n    ouicards.loadFromArray(flashcardArray)\r\n      // [{question: q1, answer: a1}, {question: q2, answer: a2}]\r\n    ouicards.loadFromBrowser(jQuerySelector, Delimiter)\r\n      // Your delimeter will most likely be ',' or '\\t'\r\n    ouicards.getFromLS()\r\n      // Get the questions and buckets from localStorge\r\n    ouicards.correct()\r\n      // Call this when the current question was answered correctly\r\n    ouicards.wrong()\r\n      // Call this when the current question was answered incorrectly\r\n    ouicards.next()\r\n      // Call this to receive a new Question/ Answer object\r\n\r\n#### Everything You Have Access To\r\n    \r\n    ouicards.currentBucket: The bucket from which the current card is being pulled.\r\n    ouicards.flashcards: Your array of flashcards.\r\n    ouicards.bucketA: All questions available in Bucket A.\r\n    ouicards.bucketB: All questions available in Bucket B.\r\n    ouicards.bucketC: All questions available in Bucket C.\r\n    ouicards.counter: A running counter. Used to know which bucket to get the next question from.\r\n\r\n    ouicards.loadFromBrowser(selector, delimiter) \r\n      // Uses jQuery to load the value of a given selector.\r\n      // This saves the questions into ouicards, localStorage AND \r\n        // returns an object with Flashcards, Bucket A, B and C.\r\n    ouicards.loadFromArray(array)\r\n      // Loads the array of questions provided into ouicards and localStorage.\r\n    ouicards.getQuestion(bucket)\r\n      // Gets a question for a given bucket and returns the built question HTML for it.\r\n    ouicards.buildQuestionHTML(rawQuestion)\r\n      // Returns a question/ answer HTML object {question: questionEl, answer: answerEl}.\r\n    ouicards.moveQuestion(fromBucket, toBucket)\r\n     // Moves a question from a given bucket to another given bucket.\r\n\r\n    ouicards.next()\r\n      // Returns a new question/ answer object.\r\n    ouicards.correct()\r\n      // Moves the current question to the next appropriate bucket.\r\n    ouicards.wrong()\r\n      // Moves the current question to Bucket A.\r\n    ouicards.saveToLS()\r\n      // Saves your flashcards, Bucket A, Bucket B and Bucket C to localStorage.\r\n    ouicards.getFromLS()\r\n      // Gets your flashcards, Bucket A, Bucket B and Bucket C from localStorage. \r\n      // This also sets ouicards.currentBucket and ouicards.counter.\r\n    ouicards.resetBuckets()\r\n      // Resets ouicards buckets. \r\n      // Bucket A will equal your flashcards array. Bucket B and C will be empty arrays.  \r\n      // Your currentBucket will also be empty and all of this will get saved to localStorage.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nHave feedback or suggestions?
